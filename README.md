# ArduinoCSV
How do you read documents on arduino?, or how do you do with a SD memory?
with this librery you can read documens in CSV, you can find a date with two numbers
This a extend of File class, you can use File with normaly, this agree a uses more
I wanted to do the most efficient for learn dates in a document
